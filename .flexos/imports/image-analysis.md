Okay, I will process the image analysis results and create a markdown asset report for your website redesign. Please provide the `{{p10_analyze_images.results}}` data so I can generate the report.

Once you provide the image analysis data, I will create the report structured as follows:

```markdown
## Asset Triage Summary

*   **Total Images:** \[Number]
*   **KEEP:** \[Number]
*   **REMAKE:** \[Number]
*   **REPLACE:** \[Number]
*   **DITCH:** \[Number]

## Logo

\[Description of the logo, whether it was found, whether it can be extracted, and recommendations for redesign.  Examples:  "A logo was detected, a blue square with the letters 'ACME' in white. The image resolution is low. The logo should be redesigned for scalability and modern aesthetics." OR "No logo was automatically detected.  Ensure a high-resolution vector logo exists and is available for the redesign."]

## Hero Candidates

\[List of images that could be used as hero backgrounds, video sources, or key visuals. Include the URL of each image and a brief justification. Examples:

*   `[URL 1]`: High-resolution image of the product in use; suitable for a hero background with text overlay.
*   `[URL 2]`: Short video clip of the team working; potential for a compelling hero video.
]

## Authentic Content (KEEP)

\[List of real photos of the team, office, products, and work. Include the URL of each image and a brief description. Examples:

*   `[URL 3]`: Photo of the team at a company event.
*   `[URL 4]`: Product demonstration video.
*   `[URL 5]`: Image of the office workspace.
]

## Needs Replacement

\[List of stock photos and generic images that should be replaced. Include the URL of each image and a description of the type of replacement needed. Examples:

*   `[URL 6]`: Generic image of a business handshake. **Replacement:** Authentic photo of the team meeting with a client.
*   `[URL 7]`: Stock photo of a smiling customer. **Replacement:** Real customer testimonial with a photo or video.
*   `[URL 8]`: Abstract image used as a section divider. **Replacement:**  Branded graphic element or a subtle background texture that aligns with the new design.]

## Ditch Pile

\[List of images to be discarded, including tiny GIFs, dated decorative elements, broken images, and tracking pixels. Include the URL of each image and a brief reason for ditching it.  Examples:

*   `[URL 9]`: 1x1 pixel tracking GIF. **Reason:** Tracking pixel, unnecessary.
*   `[URL 10]`: Animated GIF of a spinning globe. **Reason:** Dated and distracting decorative element.
*   `[URL 11]`: Broken image link. **Reason:** Broken link, image is missing.
*   `[URL 12]`: Low-resolution clip art of a telephone. **Reason:** Low quality, outdated.
]

## Recommendations

\[Overall assessment of the image situation, including whether the site has strong assets or needs to start from scratch. Recommendations for new photos/images and video opportunities. Examples:

*   **Overall Image Situation:** The site has a mix of strong authentic content and dated stock photos. The logo needs to be updated.
*   **New Photos/Images Needed:**
    *   Professional headshots of the team.
    *   High-quality product photos with lifestyle context.
