I have conducted a thorough search for the online presence of Wimmer EDV (https://wimmer-edv.at/) beyond their official website.

Here's what I found:

---

### **1. Official Website Analysis (Initial Check)**

*   **Website:** https://wimmer-edv.at/
*   **Observations:** The website is a modern, responsive site. It prominently displays contact information (address, phone, email). I searched for social media icons or links (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) but **found none directly linked on the website**. This often indicates a limited or non-existent social media presence.
