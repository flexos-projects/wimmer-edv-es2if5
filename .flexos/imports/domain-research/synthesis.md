### ## The Story

The narrative of Wimmer EDV is one of **proven expertise and personal commitment**.

This isn't a large, impersonal corporation. It's the culmination of a single expert's career. After more than two decades in the IT industry, Franz Wimmer founded Wimmer EDV to provide the kind of service he knew local businesses needed: direct, personal, and reliable.

He is the **local IT specialist** for businesses that are too small for an in-house IT department but too vital to risk their technology failing. The story is about being the dependable, go-to partner who understands the specific challenges of regional SMEs and provides stable, long-term solutions. It’s a story of trust built on years of experience and a deep connection to the local community.

### ## What They're Known For

Wimmer EDV has an exceptionally strong and positive reputation built on tangible proof points. They are known for:

*   **Exceptional Ratings & Trust:**
    *   **4.8 stars** from 34 Google reviews.
    *   **4.9 stars** from 17 Herold.at reviews.
    *   This is overwhelming social proof of consistent customer satisfaction.

*   **Core Reputation Themes (from real customer reviews):**
    *   **Speed & Responsiveness:** "schnelle Hilfe" (quick help), "rasche und unkomplizierte Hilfe" (quick and uncomplicated help).
    *   **Competence & Expertise:** "sehr kompetent" (very competent), "fachlich Top" (professionally top-notch), "lösen Probleme" (they solve problems).

*   **Key Partnerships & Certifications:** The current site highlights expertise with industry-standard solutions like **Microsoft 365**, **ESET** (antivirus), and **Securepoint** (firewalls/security), signaling professional competence.

### ## The Competitive Reality

The competitive landscape is defined by other regional IT service providers in Styria targeting the same SME market. While Wimmer EDV's current website is modern and functional, the competitive reality is not about catching up, but about **standing out**.

*   **Industry Standard:** The standard for IT service providers in the region is a professional, modern, and clean website. A company's website is a direct reflection of its technological competence.
*   **The Opportunity:** Competitors may list similar services, but few can match Wimmer EDV's combination of **deep personal experience (Franz Wimmer's 20+ years)** and **overwhelmingly positive, public-facing reviews**. The opportunity lies in making these differentiators the undeniable centerpiece of the website. The fight isn't on features; it's on **trust**.

### ## Content Goldmine

There is a wealth of authentic, powerful content ready to be leveraged for the new site.

*   **Review Snippets:** 50+ glowing reviews across Google and Herold.at provide a near-endless supply of testimonials. Phrases like "Ein verlässlicher Partner!" and "Probleme werden schnell und unkompliziert gelöst" are perfect for homepage callouts and service pages.
*   **Social Proof Metrics:** The high ratings (4.8/4.9 stars) and review counts (34/17) are powerful trust signals that must be displayed prominently.
*   **The Founder's Story:** Franz Wimmer's 20+ years of experience before founding the company is a credible and compelling narrative that builds authority.
*   **Authentic Imagery:** Photos of the office and team from the Google Business Profile can be used to add a human touch and show the real people behind the business.
*   **Clear Service List:** The existing breakdown of services is clear and provides a solid foundation for more benefit-oriented content.

### ## The Gaps

Identifying what's missing highlights clear priorities for the redesign project.

*   **No Social Media Presence:** There is no active Facebook Business Page, LinkedIn Company Page, or Instagram. This limits channels for proactive marketing and community engagement.
*   **Underutilized Founder Story:** The "About Us" section could be significantly more personal and impactful by focusing on Franz Wimmer's journey and mission.
*   **No Case Studies:** The site lacks detailed customer stories or case studies that demonstrate how they solved a specific problem for a specific type of client (e.g., a local law firm, a manufacturing SME).
*   **Lack of Thought Leadership:** There is no blog, news, or insights section. This is a missed opportunity to share expertise on topics relevant to their clients (e.g., "3 Security Tips for Styrian SMEs") and improve SEO.
*   **Testimonials Not Centralized:** The incredible reviews from Google/Herold are not integrated into the website, leaving their most powerful asset siloed off-site.

### ## Redesign Recommendations

The new website must be a tool for building immediate trust and clearly communicating Wimmer EDV's value as a reliable, expert partner.

*   **The #1 Goal:** The new site must communicate **Trust, Reliability, and Local Expertise.** Every design and content decision should serve this primary goal.

*   **Key Strategic Recommendations:**
    1.  **Lead with Social Proof:** The homepage hero section must immediately feature the 4.8 and 4.9-star ratings from Google and Herold.at. This is their strongest differentiator.
    2.  **Humanize the Brand:** Create a compelling "About Us" page that tells Franz Wimmer's story. Use professional photos of him and the office. Make clients feel they are hiring a person, not a faceless company.
    3.  **Create a "Wall of Love" (Testimonials Page):** Build a dedicated page that aggregates the best reviews from Google and Herold.at. Make it filterable by service if possible. Sprinkle the best quotes throughout the entire site.
    4.  **Structure Services Around Client Problems:** Reframe the service descriptions. Instead of just "Data Backup," use a headline like "Protect Your Business from Data Loss." Focus on the benefit and peace of mind you provide.
    5.  **Implement Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** The site needs clear, consistent buttons like "Request a Free Consultation" or "Get IT Support Now." Make the phone number and email address prominent on every page.

*   **Essential Features:**
    *   **Contact Form:** A simple, clear contact form is essential.
    *   **Service Pages:** Dedicated pages for each core service area (e.g., IT Security, Microsoft 365, Network Support).
    *   **Testimonials Section:** A dynamic feed or curated page of top reviews.
    *   **Language:** Keep the site exclusively in **German**, as this is the language of their target market. Multilingual support is not a priority.
