#### 3. Standard in their Industry for Websites (IT vs. other local businesses)

*   **IT Consultants (Schärding/Region):** The standard is definitively **modern and professional**. IT companies, by their nature, are expected to be technologically current, and their websites reflect this. A dated site could signal a lack of technical prowess or innovation.
*   **Law Firms (Schärding):** To gauge broader local professional service expectations, a quick look at law firms ("Rechtsanwalt Schärding"):
    *   **Kanzlei Pichler (ra-pichler.at):** Modern, clean, professional.
    *   **Rechtsanwaltskanzlei Dr. Josef Gruber (rechtsanwalt-gruber.at):** Modern, very professional, excellent design.
    *   **Overall:** Even in traditionally more conservative professions like law, the local standard for websites is modern and professional.

**Conclusion:** The expectation for a modern, high-quality website is universal for professional services in this region, and particularly acute for IT companies.

#### 4. Price Positioning

*   Based on their online presence, none of the competitors signal a "budget" or "low-cost" positioning.
*   Their professional websites, focus on comprehensive solutions, managed services, and business partnerships suggest they are targeting **mid-to-premium range** clients (SMEs) who prioritize reliability, expertise, and long-term support over the cheapest option.
*   Pricing for IT services is rarely listed publicly due to the customized nature of the work, but the overall branding and communication imply value-based pricing.

#### 5. What Makes Wimmer EDV Different?

*   **Longevity & Experience:** "Seit über 25 Jahren Ihr EDV Spezialist." This is a significant differentiator. It implies stability, accumulated knowledge, established local reputation, and trustworthiness – crucial factors for businesses selecting an IT partner. Most competitors highlight experience, but Wimmer EDV's "25+ years" is a concrete, strong claim.
*   **Local Roots:** Being a long-standing business in Schärding fosters trust and local connections.
*   **Certifications:** Their mention of being "Microsoft zertifiziert" (Microsoft certified partner/specialist) is a strong signal of technical competence and adherence to industry standards, particularly valuable for business clients.
*   **Broad Service Portfolio:** Wimmer EDV offers a wide range of services, including web design, e-commerce, and custom software development, in addition to standard IT support. This "one-stop-shop" approach could be a differentiator if effectively communicated, allowing clients to consolidate their IT needs with a single partner. Many competitors focus more exclusively on "business IT solutions."
*   **Personalized Service:** While not explicitly unique, longer-standing local businesses often pride themselves on a personal touch and strong client relationships.

#### 6. Service Area

*   **Primary:** Local (Schärding and immediate surroundings).
*   **Regional:** "Wir sind in ganz Oberösterreich und darüber hinaus tätig" (We are active throughout Upper Austria and beyond). This confirms a regional focus on Upper Austria (Innviertel region).
*   **Potential Cross-Border:** Given the proximity to Passau, Germany (a major regional hub), it's highly likely they serve clients in that area, or that businesses in Passau would consider Wimmer EDV.

### Implications for the Redesign

The research clearly indicates that Wimmer EDV's current website is a **significant competitive disadvantage**.

*   **A modern, professional, and responsive website is not merely an advantage; it's a fundamental requirement to meet industry standards and competitor expectations.**
*   The redesign needs to match or exceed the online presentation quality of competitors like net-point.at, b2b-edv.at, and Hagn EDV.
*   The new site should clearly and prominently highlight Wimmer EDV's core differentiators:
    *   **Over 25 years of experience/longevity.**
    *   **Microsoft certifications.**
    *   **Local roots and personalized service.**
    *   **Comprehensive "one-stop-shop" service portfolio** (if this is a strategic advantage they wish to emphasize, otherwise, clarity on their main focus).
*   The design should convey professionalism, trustworthiness, and competence, aligning with a **mid-to-premium price positioning**.
*   The service area (local, regional across Upper Austria, and potentially Passau) should be clear, establishing their reach.

A modern site will be crucial for Wimmer EDV to attract new clients, reinforce trust with existing ones, and demonstrate their technological relevance in the market.
