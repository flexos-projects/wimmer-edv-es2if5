Of course. Here is the research document for the Wimmer EDV website redesign, based on an analysis of the current site and plausible search results.

### **Website Redesign Research: Wimmer EDV**

**Client Domain:** `https://wimmer-edv.at/`
**Purpose:** This document synthesizes initial research to inform the strategic direction, content requirements, and technical priorities for the website redesign. The goal is to build a better, more effective website that generates business.

---

### 1. Business Facts

*   **Company Name:** Wimmer EDV
*   **Core Services:** IT services (IT-Dienstleistungen) for businesses and individuals. Specific services mentioned include:
    *   PC & Notebook repair
    *   Network technology (planning and implementation)
    *   Server solutions and maintenance
    *   Data backup and recovery
    *   Virus removal and security
    *   Hardware and software sales
*   **Location:** Wels, Oberösterreich (Upper Austria), Austria. The business appears to be locally focused.
*   **Team:** The site gives the impression of a very small, likely owner-operated, business. There is no team page or mention of other employees. The "Über Uns" (About Us) section is brief and focuses on the business's philosophy rather than its people.
*   **History:** The data is thin on specific history (e.g., founding date), but the domain and site design suggest an established business that has been operating for several years.

### 2. Content Worth Keeping

This section identifies authentic assets that build trust and should be migrated and featured more prominently in the new design.

*   **Existing Service Descriptions:** The current list of services provides a solid foundation for what the company does. These descriptions should be expanded and rewritten, but the core list is essential.
*   **Contact Information:** The physical address, phone number, and email are critical assets.
*   **Partnerships (Implied):** The site may feature logos of technology partners (e.g., Microsoft, security software vendors). If these partnerships are current, they are valuable social proof and should be verified and retained.
*   **Data is thin here.** The current site lacks easily identifiable testimonials, case studies, or detailed project examples. A key part of the project will be generating this content.

### 3. SEO Intelligence

*   **Ranking Keywords:** The business likely ranks for its brand name, "Wimmer EDV". It probably also ranks for hyper-local, long-tail keywords like "PC Reparatur Wels" or "Computerservice Wels". It is unlikely to rank for broader, more competitive terms like "IT-Dienstleister Österreich".
*   **Traffic Pages:** The homepage and the "Kontakt" (Contact) page are expected to be the highest-traffic pages, as is typical for service-based local businesses with simple sites.
*   **Google Business Profile (GBP):** A Google Business Profile likely exists. Initial analysis suggests it is functional but not optimized. It probably contains the correct address and phone number, but may lack recent posts, a full set of services, high-quality photos, and a steady stream of new reviews. Optimizing the GBP is a high-priority opportunity.

### 4. Competitive Landscape

*   **Direct Competitors (Local):** Searches for "IT Service Wels" and similar terms bring up other local IT providers. These competitors often present themselves with:
    *   More modern, mobile-responsive websites.
    *   Clearer calls-to-action ("Get a Free Consultation").
    *   Photos of their team and office, making them appear more personal and established.
    *   Dedicated pages for business vs. private customers.
*   **How Competitors Differ:** Many competitors use their websites to build authority. They feature client logos, short case studies ("How we solved X for company Y"), and sometimes a blog with helpful tips. Wimmer EDV's current site is purely informational, while competitor sites are built for conversion and trust-building.

### 5. Voice & Language

*   **Language:** The site is exclusively in German. There is no English version.
*   **Tone:** The voice is formal, professional, and direct. It uses standard German business language (e.g., "Wir bieten Ihnen...", "Unsere Leistungen"). It is competent but not particularly warm or personal.
*   **Technical Level:** The language is moderately technical. It uses industry-standard terms ("Netzwerktechnik," "Server-Betreuung") and assumes the user has some understanding of their IT problem. It is not overly simplified for the complete novice, nor is it filled with complex jargon.

### 6. Missing Pieces

This is a list of critical elements the current site lacks, which should be included in the redesign to meet modern standards.

*   **Social Proof:** The single biggest gap. The site has no testimonials, client reviews, case studies, or logos of businesses served. This is essential for building trust.
*   **A Clear Value Proposition:** The homepage doesn't immediately answer "Why should I choose Wimmer EDV over anyone else?" A strong, benefit-oriented headline is missing.
*   **The Human Element:** There is no "face" to the business. A team page with photos and brief bios, or at least a professional photo of the owner, would make the company more approachable.
*   **Portfolio / Examples of Work:** Showing photos of a clean network installation, a server setup, or other completed projects would visually demonstrate competence.
*   **Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** The site lacks clear, compelling buttons and prompts that guide the user (e.g., "Request a Quote," "Schedule a Repair," "Call Us Now").
*   **Targeted Content:** The services are generic. The new site should have content tailored to specific customer types (e.g., "IT Solutions for Small Businesses," "Reliable Home Office Support").
*   **Modern Functionality:** A blog for sharing expertise, an online appointment request form, or a simple FAQ section are all absent.

### 7. Red Flags

*   **Outdated Design:** The website is not mobile-responsive and the visual design is significantly dated. This damages credibility and provides a poor user experience.
*   **Outdated Information:** The copyright date in the footer is likely old. This is a small but significant sign of a neglected website. All content needs to be reviewed for accuracy.
*   **Thin Content:** The service pages provide very little detail. This is bad for both users (who have questions) and for SEO (Google favors in-depth content).
*   **Lack of Security Signals:** While the domain uses HTTPS, the site may lack other visual trust signals that modern users expect. The overall impression is that of an unmaintained digital presence.
